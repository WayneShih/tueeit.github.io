Our origin can be traced to the spring of 2009 while the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) laid off over 800 employees (the biggest lay-off in the TSMC history) due to the global financial crisis, which brought a group of IT workers trying to organize a union. Then, in February of 2011, a HTC engineer passed away because of overworking. That tragedy rebooted the attempt to organize an IT workers’ union and finally lead to the birth of TUEEIT. Currently, we have 422 members who are mostly IT engineers.</p><p>After the establishment, the first campaign of TUEEIT was demanding the Taiwanese government to abolish the Article 84-1 of the Labor Standard Act which removes the restrictions on working hours. To those occupations—including IT engineer—applied to the Article 84-1, employers can legally make workers work longer than regular hours without overtime pay. Besides protesting against and lobbying the government, TUEEIT also advocates to the public about the harms that overworking does to workers and their families. Although the goal of abolishing Article 84-1 hasn’t accomplished presently, the campaign does raise the public concern of overworking issue.</p><p>The abolishing Article 84-1 campaign was not the only task that TUEEIT has devoted into. Among all the battles that TUEEIT has engaged, the surveillance on the Advanced Semiconductor Engineering Company (ASE) at 2013-2014 was another significant one. At the end of 2013, an ASE’s factory in Kaohsiung was found discharging toxic wastewater into a river and merely given a slight fine by the government. Therefore, TUEEIT and several unions cooperated with environmental and community organizations and successfully pushed the government closing down that factory until the pollution removed. Further, by the pressure from the surveillance campaign, ASE paid full salaries to workers serving in that factory during the closing down. The experience of ASE surveillance campaign showed the coherence of workers’ rights and environment protection. We are very proud of participating in that case.</p><p>Of course, public campaigns are only a partial of TUEEIT’s work. Beyond the media attention, we spend most efforts on doing daily organizing such as labor education and consultation to workers. Due to the favors on enterprise unions in Taiwanese labor laws, TUEEIT has assisted the organizing of several unions in different IT companies and remaining alliance with them. At this time of the 10th anniversary of TUEEIT, we are looking forward to do more contributions on the rights and benefits of all IT workers.</p></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/","query":{},"buildId":"wyq2owPztu4dp2b5e2NZD","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
